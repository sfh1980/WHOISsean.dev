## How I Got Here: My Journey Into Tech and What Comes Next  

### A Quick Look Back  

Some time before 2020, after many late-night talks with my wife and a lot of research, I made a big decision: I was going to quit my job and attend a **coding bootcamp**. Becoming a **web/app developer** seemed like a strong career move — a chance to do something creative, in-demand, and future-focused.  

Then COVID hit, and those plans were put on hold. But in 2022, I finally took the leap. I quit my job and enrolled at **Coding Dojo** to begin my journey into **development**.

The road from then to now has been filled with anxiety, growth, and a lot of late nights. I still consider myself a **junior developer**, and yes, **imposter syndrome** still pops up from time to time. But despite everything, I have no regrets. Better late than never to chase a better life.

### The High Point  

In 2024, I worked an **apprenticeship with the Richmond Ambulance Authority**, which eventually turned into a **full-time developer position**. For the first time, I truly saw my work in code turn into something tangible — I was officially a *junior developer*. It was validating, exciting, and exactly what I’d hoped for when I started this journey.

### The Setback  

Then, in October 2025, things took a turn. The position I held was **eliminated due to organizational restructuring**, and just like that, I found myself **unemployed again**.  

It was a tough moment — but also a moment to pause, regroup, and figure out my **next steps in tech**.

### What Comes Next  

This blog will document the next phase of my journey:  
- How I’m adding to my **developer portfolio**  
- How I’m keeping my **coding skills sharp** while unemployed  
- The **projects, technologies, and certifications** I’m using to make myself employable again  
- What I learn about the **tech job market** along the way  

If you’ve gone through a career change, faced layoffs, or are trying to **re-enter tech**, maybe my experiences can help you too.
