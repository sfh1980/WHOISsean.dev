## ABC : Always Be Coding

### If I've Said It Once...

I get the feeling many of my blog posts on this site will cover, and re-cover, a lot of similar information. For example: how I came to use the Cursor IDE.

I remember like it was yesterday...

Actually, I'm old; I have a hard time remembering what I had for breakfast this morning. But I do remember who turned me on to this amazing IDE. 

In my coding journey, I first began using Visual Studio Code as that was the first IDE we used when I went through a coding bootcamp. The next IDE was Spring Tools Suite. Admittedly, Java was not fun to learn. In my first role as a Jr Developer, I introduced myself to Visual Studio to work on projects in Visual Basic and C#. Somewhere in the chaos of learning all of these IDEs and languages and working project after project, a neighbor suggested I check out the Cursor IDE. Twenty dollars later for a yearly subscription, and it has been incredibly instrumental in how I carried on as a developer. 

Using Cursor allowed me to control the workflow and pace of the project. It allowed me to ask why a line of code worked. It allowed me to give it rules as to how I wanted it to perform. It allowed me to continue my learned mantra of "Little code, test. Little code, test." It was, in my opinion, the perfect tool—everything I needed in one application. And the constant updates to the application just served to introduce better ways of keeping on track when I worked.

### And Now for the Reason Behind This Blog Post: Developer Q, Q CLI, and Kiro IDE

Recently, after reconnecting with one of my coding bootcamp instructors over LinkedIn and Discord, more new tools were added to my bag of tricks: Q Developer/Q CLI and Kiro, all tools from AWS/Amazon. I successfully used Q Developer and Q CLI to participate in a hackathon that created this very blog website. The prospect of actually using Kiro after watching my old instructor give a demonstration is exciting. I am currently working on an All-In-One life mobile app designed to help young adults just leaving the nest and exploring the real world, as well as higher-functioning individuals with ASD/ADHD, with real-life tasks in as many aspects of their daily life as possible. I'd like to see how Kiro takes my project in its current state and runs with it. 

Subsequent posts will illustrate the many ways that I hope Kiro will help me tackle this project. So stick around, and let me know what you think.
