Hey there — welcome to my new tech blog at whoissean.dev.

What you’ll find here
- Practical build logs and lessons from my projects (web/mobile)
- My experience using agentic developer tools (especially Cursor)
- A required deep-dive on Agentic CLI tools and MCP servers (draft is live and evolving)
- Accessibility-aware design ideas inspired by my ongoing “life app” project

How this site is built
- Stack: Jekyll + GitHub Pages + a minimalist dark theme
- Source-first: `_layouts`, `_includes`, and `_posts` generate the site; `_site/` is build output
- CI: pushing to `main` triggers a Pages build; changes go live in ~1–3 minutes
- Comments: enabled per post via GitHub Discussions (Giscus) at the bottom

Contribute/engage
- Leave a comment with ideas or questions at the bottom of any post
- Share posts you find useful — it helps others discover the content

Roadmap (near-term)
- Publish the “Agentic CLI Tools + MCP” article with screenshots and short clips
- Add analytics and SEO defaults; tune responsiveness
- Write up the accessibility thread from my life app work

Thanks for stopping by — I’m keeping posts concise, useful, and honest. If you’re curious how something was built or why I chose an approach, ask in the comments and I’ll dig in.
